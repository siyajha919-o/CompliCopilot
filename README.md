## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

### **Monorepo Layout**
- **frontend/**: Static PWA pages, assets, and a simple dev server.
- **backend/**: API scaffold built with FastAPI.
- **cloud/**: Stubs for OCR/AI modules.
- **docker/**: Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml for local stack.
- **docs/**: Design and architecture documentation.

### **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **Backend**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL.
- **AI/OCR**: Cloud-based AI pipelines for data extraction.
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend), Docker (local development).

## üöÄ Quick Start

### **Frontend Only**
1. Install Node.js 18+.
2. From `frontend/`, serve static files using any static server. Example:
   ```bash
   npx http-server -p 3000 ..\ -c-1
   ```
3. Open: [http://localhost:3000/frontend/pages/index.html](http://localhost:3000/frontend/pages/index.html).

### **Dockerized Setup**
1. From the repo root, run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build
   ```
2. Access the frontend at `http://localhost:3000` and backend at `http://localhost:8000`.
