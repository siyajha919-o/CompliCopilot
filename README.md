## üåü Project Overview

### **The Idea**
CompliCopilot simplifies expense management for small businesses by automating the tedious process of receipt handling. Our advanced OCR system extracts vendor names, dates, and amounts with high precision, while AI categorizes expenses automatically.

### **Problem Statement**
Small businesses often struggle with:
- Manual receipt handling and data entry errors
- Time-consuming expense categorization
- Lack of compliance with tax regulations
- Difficulty in organizing financial records

### **Innovation & Implementation**
- **Advanced OCR Pipeline**: Multi-stage image preprocessing with Tesseract OCR
- **Smart Data Extraction**: Regex-based parsing with confidence scoring
- **Seamless Authentication**: Google OAuth integration via Firebase
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant receipt analysis and form population
- **Export Capabilities**: One-click CSV generation for accounting software

### **Market Potential**
The global market for expense management software is projected to reach **$10 billion** by 2030. CompliCopilot aims to capture a significant share by targeting small and medium-sized businesses.
